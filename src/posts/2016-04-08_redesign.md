Finally I got rid of the plain-jane [Ghost](https://ghost.org) theme and replaced it with a custom made one by my brother, [Marian Friedmann](https://marianfriedmann.de). In the course of the release of the redesign, I also switched from Ghost back to a static site generator called [metalsmith]() to run this blog. 

Now why is that, you ask? Well, I already wrote about the advantages of *SSG*s over dynamic driven blogs three years ago in my [very first blog post](https://blog.frd.mn/welcome-to-ghost/). Give it a read if you are interested in the recent decision.

Last but not least, I pushed the complete source code of this blog (including [the posts itself](https://github.com/frdmn/blog.frd.mn/tree/master/src/posts)) to [GitHub](https://github.com/frdmn/blog.frd.mn). Feel free to send a *pull request* in case you found a typo or mistake and if you're willing to contribute!
